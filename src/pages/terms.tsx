          a. General Use. Subject to and conditioned upon your continued
          compliance with the terms of this License, ** EDIT ** Gallery Oy
          grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use,
          copy, and display the Art associated with your Purchased NFTs, solely
          for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial
          use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale
          of your NFTs, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies
          each NFT owner’s rights to display the Art associated with their
          Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can display the
          Art; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that
          permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your NFTs,
          provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each
          NFT owner’s rights to display the Art associated with their Purchased
          NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and
          provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the
          Purchased NFT leaves the website/application.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          b. Commercial Use. Subject to and conditioned upon your continued
          compliance with the terms of this License, ** EDIT ** Gallery Oy
          grants you a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, license to use, copy,
          and display the Art associated with your Purchased NFTs for the
          purpose of commercializing your own merchandise that includes,
          contains, or consists of the Art associated with your Purchased NFTs
          (“Commercial Use”), provided that such Commercial Use does not result
          in you earning more than One Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars
          ($150,000.00) in gross annually. For the sake of clarity, nothing in
          this Section 3.b will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or
          operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of NFTs
          generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies
          each NFT owner’s rights to display the Art associated with their
          Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can display the
          Art; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application
          that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of NFTs
          generally, provided that the third party website or application
          cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights to display the Art
          associated with their Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the actual
          owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer
          visible once the owner of the Purchased NFT leaves the
          website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the
          foregoing, even where such revenue is in excess of $150,000 per year.

          c. Transferability and Sublicensing. The License granted hereunder is
          not assignable or transferable except in connection with your sale of
          the Purchased NFT, and you acknowledge and agree that upon such sale
          the License shall be transferred by operation of law and the terms of
          this License to the person or entity to whom you convey Ownership of
          the Purchased NFT. While you Own the Purchased NFT, you may sublicense
          your rights under the License to third parties, but only on condition
          that such sublicenses shall terminate upon any change in Ownership of
          the Purchased NFT. Following termination of a sublicense, physical
          embodiments of the Art lawfully made under such sublicenses, such as
          merchandise in inventory, may continue to be distributed as provided
          under Finnish Copyright Law.

        <Text>
          You agree that you may not, nor permit any third party to do or
          attempt to do any of the foregoing without ** EDIT ** Gallery Oy’s
          express prior written consent in each case: (i) modify the Art
          associated with your Purchased NFT in any way, including, without
          limitation, the shapes, traits, designs, drawings, attributes,
          cropping or color schemes; (ii) use the Art associated with your
          Purchased NFTs to advertise, market, or sell any third party product
          or service; (iii) use the Art associated with your Purchased NFTs in
          connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that depict
          hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could
          reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe
          upon the rights of others; (iv) use the Art associated with your
          Purchased NFTs in movies, videos, or any other forms of media, except
          to the limited extent that such use is expressly permitted in Section
          3(b) above or solely for your own personal, non-commercial use; (v)
          sell, distribute for commercial gain (including, without limitation,
          giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial gain), or otherwise
          commercialize merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the
          Art associated with your Purchased NFTs, except as expressly permitted
          in Section 3(b) above; (vi) attempt to trademark, copyright, or
          otherwise acquire intellectual property rights in or to the Art
          associated with your Purchased NFTs; or (vii) otherwise utilize the
          Art associated with your Purchased NFTs for your or any third party’s
          commercial benefit, except as expressly permitted in Section 3(b)
          above. To the extent that Art associated with your Purchased NFTs
          contains Third Party IP (e.g., licensed intellectual property from a
          celebrity, athlete, or other public figure), you understand and agree
          as follows: (w) that you will not have the right to use such Third
          Party IP in any way except as incorporated in the Art, and subject to
          the License and restrictions contained herein; (x) that the Commercial
          Use license in Section 3(b) above will not apply; (y) that, depending
          on the nature of the license granted from the owner of the Third Party
          IP, ** EDIT ** Gallery Oy may need to pass through additional
          restrictions on your ability to use the Art; and (z) to the extent
          that ** EDIT ** Gallery Oy informs you of such additional restrictions
          in writing (email is permissible), you will be responsible for
          complying with all such restrictions from the date that you receive
          the notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of this
          License. The restriction in this Section 4 will survive the expiration
          or termination of this License.

        <Heading>5. Terms of License</Heading>
        <Text>
          The License granted in Section 3 above applies only to the extent that
          you continue to Own the applicable Purchased NFT. If at any time you
          sell, trade, donate, give away, or otherwise transfer Ownership of
          your Purchased NFT for any reason, the License granted in Section 3
          will immediately be transferred to the new Owner with respect to that
          NFT as set forth above in Section 3.c. without the requirement of
          notice, and you will have no further rights in or to the Art
          associated with that NFT. If you exceed the $150,000 limitation on
          annual gross revenue set forth in Section 3.b above, you will be in
          breach of this License, and must send an email to ** EDIT ** within
          fifteen (15) days, with the phrase “NFT License - Commercial Use” in
          the subject line, requesting a discussion with ** EDIT ** Gallery Oy
          regarding entering into a broader license agreement or obtaining an
          exemption (which may be granted or withheld in ** EDIT ** Gallery Oy’s
          sole and absolute discretion). If you exceed the scope of the license
          grant in Section 3.b without entering into a broader license agreement
          with or obtaining an exemption from ** EDIT ** Gallery Oy, you
          acknowledge and agree that: (i) you are in breach of this License;
          (ii) in addition to any remedies that may be available to ** EDIT **
          Gallery Oy at law or in equity, ** EDIT ** Gallery Oy may immediately
          terminate this License, without the requirement of notice; and (iii)
          you will be responsible to reimburse ** EDIT ** Gallery Oy for any
          costs and expenses incurred by ** EDIT ** Gallery Oy during the course
          of enforcing the terms of this License against you. Studio Pekka **
